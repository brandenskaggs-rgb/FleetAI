# Fleet AI

Fleet AI is a predictive maintenance and fleet intelligence platform focused on **preventing breakdowns before they happen**, not just tracking vehicles.

This repository hosts a **public demo** of the Fleet AI operator dashboard using simulated data.

🔗 **Live Demo:**

## What Fleet AI Does

Fleet AI turns vehicle data into **clear, actionable decisions** for fleet operators.

Instead of reacting to roadside failures, the platform is designed to surface insights like:
- *“This fuel pump is likely to fail within the next 48–72 hours.”*
- *“This issue can be bundled with scheduled maintenance.”*
- *“Ignoring this trend risks a $10k–$30k downtime event.”*

The emphasis is on **uptime, cost avoidance, and decision clarity**, especially for diesel and Class 8 operations.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated in the Demo

This demo showcases the **operator-facing experience**, including:

- **Predictive Maintenance Prioritization**
  - Do now / Do soon / Can wait
  - Risk-ranked maintenance actions

- **Financial Framing**
  - Estimated cost exposure
  - Avoided downtime modeling
  - ROI-focused decision support

- **Live Telemetry Simulation**
  - Sensor trends
  - Anomaly detection
  - Event logging

- **Fleet AI Advisor (Conceptual)**
  - Fleet-only, business-focused insights
  - Maintenance and cost-oriented responses

> ⚠️ All data in this demo is simulated. No real vehicles, GPS, or cameras are accessed.

## What Fleet AI Is *Not*

- Not just GPS tracking  
- Not just camera monitoring  
- Not another generic fleet dashboard  

Fleet AI treats traditional fleet tools (GPS, cameras, safety) as **supporting layers**, while **preventable maintenance and cost reduction remain the core focus**.

## Technology Status

- Frontend: HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Data: Simulated / mock telemetry
- Backend: Not implemented (demo-only)
- Hosting: GitHub Pages

This repository represents a **concept and UI prototype**, not a production system.

---

## Roadmap (High-Level)

Planned evolution toward commercial launch (target: **late 2026**):

- Real vehicle data ingestion
- Predictive model development
- Diesel and Class 8–specific failure modeling
- GPS, safety, and camera data integration
- Operator + executive reporting layers
- Pilot programs with real fleets

## Demo Disclaimer

This is a **demo environment** intended for demonstration and discussion purposes only.

- No live vehicle data
- No real GPS tracking
- No live camera feeds
- No operational decisions should be made from this demo
